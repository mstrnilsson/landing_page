<h4>Hi, I’m Carmen Schäfer.
Alias Loli Bäh.
</h4>
<br>
<h4>In my early years I was formed as a fashion designer in Barcelona; city where I also did my first professional steps, as designer for Nike, Ailanto and Elisa Amann. 
Later, I entered LOEWE as a member of the designing team for the womens collection, leaded by Jose Enrique Oña Selfa as Artistic Director before launching my own label, CarmenSchäfer.
With my own brand, I sold my own collections, but also designed costumes, sceneries and did GeneralCoordination for events like “NUDAGE” or the “Muestra Internacional de Jóvenes Diseñadores de Moda”, both presented by the Gobierno de Cantabria.
</h4>
<br> 
<h4>After having grown up my kids, I relaunched myself in a project, that gathers all of my passions in one.
So, for my illustrations, I can let my mind fly far away to design all those characters through slow craftmanship, done by conscious upcycling, and also I can draw, draw and draw, and bring to life all that creative magic world, that I love so much.
</h4>
<br>
<h4>I hope you enjoy the journey :)
